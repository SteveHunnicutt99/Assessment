<p>Presented by best-selling author and gold expert&#8230; JAMES G. RICKARDS<p>
<p>I&#39;m going to show you&#8230;</p>

<p>How a class of &#8220;off-limit&#8221; gold stocks could become fair game and shoot up in price&#8230;</p>
<p>Why just as many gold stocks could be CRUSHED. But this isn&#39;t a bad thing. In fact, itâ€™s going to open up a unique opportunity not seen in years&#8230;</p>
<p>How it could compound an announcement from the Federal Reserve next week that could send physical gold prices much higher&#8230;</p>
<p>Why you&#39;ll hear predictions of doom for the gold market (it&#39;s important you understand the truth and know the real profit opportunity that&#39;s being set up)&#8230;</p>
<p>Why we may see confirmation that gold will make a run at $2,000 sooner than anyone thinks&#8230;</p>
